                        <p class="paragraph">
                            The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices as
                            there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog
                            offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of
                            having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog.
                            Studies even show medical indicators such as reduced blood pressure and improved lipid
                            profiles. If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be
                            mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In this
                            page, you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
                            stages of their lives.</p>
                        <h3>Diet and Exercise</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Throughout dogs lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies
                            should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are
                            about three to six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per
                            day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced to one meal after they
                            reach one year old. And a dogs typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70
                            percent water. The ASPCA says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness,
                            and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs
                            healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies
                            greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a range of 30 to 120 minutes of
                            exercise
                            is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that
                            wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And
                            by the way, exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest.
                            Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical
                            activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay
                            careful attention to toys that require supervision.</p>
                        <h3>Grooming and Handling</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush
                            frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can
                            prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
                            especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your dogs
                            health but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the
                            soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your
                            puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how
                            you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you
                            carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the
                            chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly
                            with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear
                            as you lift.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Vaccinations and Medications</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that
                            are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as
                            hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the
                            environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include Bordetella bronchiseptica,
                            Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.
